      <h1>Climate Change Challenges in New York City</h1>
      <p>
        New York City is facing numerous challenges due to climate change, including rising sea levels, increased flooding, heatwaves, and air pollution. 
        These issues threaten the city's infrastructure, ecosystems, and public health.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Rising Sea Levels</h2>
      <p>
        As global temperatures rise, so do sea levels, posing a significant threat to coastal cities like New York. 
        Projections estimate a rise of 1-2 feet by 2050, increasing the risk of flooding and storm surges.

        ></iframe>
      </div>

      <h2>2. Increased Flooding</h2>
      <p>
        More intense rainfall and storms are leading to increased flooding in NYC, overwhelming drainage systems. 
        Notable events, like Hurricane Sandy, highlighted vulnerabilities in the cityâ€™s infrastructure.
      </p>
      <Graph type="flooding" />

      <h2>3. Urban Heat Islands</h2>
      <p>
        NYC experiences elevated temperatures due to urban heat islands, where concrete and asphalt absorb and retain heat. 
        This results in increased energy consumption and health risks during heatwaves.
      </p>
      <Graph type="heatwaves" />
      <h2><Link to="/NewYork-Pollution">4. Air Pollution</Link></h2>
      <p>
        Air quality in NYC suffers from pollution caused by traffic, industrial activities, and construction. 
        This leads to health problems like asthma and cardiovascular diseases.
      </p>
      <Graph type="pollution" />
