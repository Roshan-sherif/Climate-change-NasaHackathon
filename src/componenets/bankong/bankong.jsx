      <h1>Climate Change Challenges in Bangkok</h1>
      <p>
        Bangkok is facing numerous challenges due to climate change, including rising sea levels, increased flooding, urban heat, and air pollution. 
        These issues threaten the city's infrastructure, ecosystems, and public health.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Rising Sea Levels</h2>
      <p>
        As global temperatures rise, sea levels are also increasing, posing a significant threat to coastal cities like Bangkok. 
        Projections estimate a rise of up to 1 meter by 2050, heightening the risk of flooding and storm surges.

      <h2>2. Increased Flooding</h2>
      <p>
        More intense rainfall and storms are leading to increased flooding in Bangkok, overwhelming drainage systems. 
        Events like the 2011 floods highlighted vulnerabilities in the cityâ€™s infrastructure.
      </p>
      <Graph type="flooding" />

      <h2>3. Urban Heat Islands</h2>
      <p>
        Bangkok experiences elevated temperatures due to urban heat islands, where concrete and asphalt absorb and retain heat. 
        This leads to increased energy consumption and health risks during heatwaves.

      <h2><Link to="/Bangkok-Pollution">4. Air Pollution</Link></h2>
      <p>
        Air quality in Bangkok suffers from pollution caused by traffic, industrial activities, and construction. 
        This results in health problems such as asthma and respiratory diseases.
